      I love to travel and gain new experiences. Traveling makes me excited to see how other people live, as well as learn different cultures and backgrounds. In the future, I hope to travel twice every year with friends. You can find pictures from some of the placees Ive been to. </p>

    This is the beautiful city of Boston. We were downtown Boston on the duck tour when I took this picture. I was facinated with the historic architecture. It reminded me a lot of Brooklyn. </p>

    This was when I was going to Austin texas for two weeks. It was a wonderful stay, and I learned about the growing tech companies in Austin, as well as the vast oppurtunies for a tech career. </p>
