    <p> One of my favorite hobbies to past the time is baking! I have been baking since I was 6 years old. I find baking to be theraputic, as well as fun. Typically, I bake on Wednsdays in the afternoons. When I was in high school, Wednsday day was a half day, so I would come home and bake in order to de-stress. Check out below some of my favorite baked goods! </p>

    <p> mac and cheese is one of my favorite dishes. I decided to add a little twist by putting shrimp and chicken in it. It was very good. </p>

    <p> I made a three layer chocolate cake for myself with a strawberry fillin. It was very delicious. </p>
