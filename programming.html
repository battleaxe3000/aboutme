    <h1> How I got into programming </h1>
    <img src= "https://www.gqrgm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2.-Blog-Banner-Template.jpg">
    <p> I started programming in January 2021. I began programming with Python first, and when I got accepted into The Knowledge House, I expanded on my ever growing skills in the tech world. I didn't like programming at first because of how hard it was to learn initially. But the more I practiced, the more I came to love creating and building programs I could actually use. </p> </body>
